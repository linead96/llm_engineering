But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me."

As a pro-tip: it's best if you clear the outputs of your Jupyter notebooks (Edit >> Clean outputs of all cells, and then Save) for clean notebooks.\n",
