    "By the end of this course, you will have built an autonomous Agentic AI solution with 7 agents that collaborate to solve a business problem. All in good time! We will start with something smaller...\n",

    "Our goal is to code a new kind of Web Browser. Give it a URL, and it will respond with a summary. The Reader's Digest of the internet!!\n",

    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.\n",

    "A final thought. While I've designed these notebooks to be educational, I've also tried to make them enjoyable. We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me."

    "2. Also, double check you have the right kind of API token with the right permissions. You should find it on [this webpage](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and it should show with Permissions of \"All\". If not, try creating another key by:\n",

    "- Select **Owned by:** you, **Project:** Default project, **Permissions:** All\n",
    "- Click Create secret key, and use that new key in the code and the `.env` file (it might take a few minutes to activate)\n",
    "- Do a Kernel >> Restart kernel, and execute the cells in this Jupyter lab starting at the top\n",
    "4. As a fallback, replace the line `openai = OpenAI()` with `openai = OpenAI(api_key=\"your-key-here\")` - while it's not recommended to hard code tokens in Jupyter lab, because then you can't share your lab with others, it's a workaround for now\n",

       "- It highlights the need for improved measurement of maternal morbidity alongside mortality and outlines the objectives of the Safe Motherhood Survey (SMS) Project initiated in 1992, focusing on women's reproductive health.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Philippine Context\n",
       "- The Philippines, an archipelago of around 7,100 islands, has a diverse geography impacting its climate and development.\n",
       "- The document discusses the political and economic history of the Philippines, including developments under the Ramos administration aimed at economic recovery and social reforms.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Population Growth\n",
       "- As of the 1990 census, the population was 60.7 million, with a growth rate of 2.35% over the previous decade. The total fertility rate showed a decline, aiming for further reductions through a government program.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Health Policies and Programs\n",
       "- The Department of Health aims to ensure equitable access to healthcare. Important health initiatives include family planning, maternal health, and child nutrition.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Objectives of the SMS\n",
       "- The SMS aims to gather data on:\n",
       "  - Serious health problems in pregnant women.\n",
       "  - Utilization of antenatal and postnatal care.\n",
       "  - Chronic reproductive morbidities.\n",
       "  - Domestic violence prevalence among women.\n",
       "  - Nutritional status of ever-pregnant women.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Methodology\n",
       "- The survey was implemented by the National Statistics Office with support from the Department of Health and funding from organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation and USAID.\n",
       "- Describes a two-stage sampling method for data collection from a nationally representative sample of ever-pregnant women.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Data Collection and Processing\n",
       "- Fieldwork involved trained teams and strict data processing protocols to ensure the reliability of the collected information.\n",
       "- The data processing utilized the Integrated System for Survey Analysis (ISSA) for efficient management and analysis.\n",
       "\n",
       "This document serves to support further research and policymaking related to maternal health in the Philippines, emphasizing the importance of quality data in improving health outcomes."
